# portfolio
I have constructed a rough draft of my personal portfolio that presents several links through the site.
These include in my navigation bar a home link, about me, services, and my work/past work experiences.

My goal of creating this personal portfolio is to begin creating and adding projects I work on and push them to my portfolio site.
I utilized a freecodecamp.org youtube video to help guide me/give perspective in the construction of my site.

function of the site (personal portfolio). In addition to adding links to a beginning project of mine, I also have attached links/images 
that direct to my social media platforms.
